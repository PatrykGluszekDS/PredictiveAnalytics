# Engineering thesis - Predictive analytics in football: machine learning approach to  assessing team success factors
This thesis aims to explore critical factors leading to successful football team through 
applications of machine learning techniques as a predictive analytics tool. Random Forest 
model was built using data from historical matches in the Big Five European leagues. With 
Recursive Feature Elimination and hyperparameter tuning, the model recorded 70% 
prediction accuracy of the outcome of a match. Critical performance indicators such as Post
Shot Expected Goals, save percentage and Expected Goals are identified as the most 
significant predictors of success. Findings highlight the critical role of shot quality and 
goalkeeper performance in determining match outcomes. Moreover, they point out the 
necessity of balance between offense and defense. Insights include actionable 
recommendations for football teams, scouting divisions and managers, including focus on 
improving shot precision and enhancing goalkeeper training. These results contribute to the 
growing field of sports analytics, providing a data-driven foundation for strategic decision
making in football.
